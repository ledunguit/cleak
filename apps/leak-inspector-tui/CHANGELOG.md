# @cleak/cli

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Configure every setting via a config file. A globally-installed `cleak` can now set
  every `RunConfig` value — the static/dynamic analyzer endpoints, LLM provider/tuning,
  workflow and consensus knobs — through `~/.config/cleak/config.json` (read at the single
  `loadConfig()` chokepoint, so the TUI, `scan`, `eval` and `tools` all honour it).
  - New `cleak config` subcommand: `path | init | get [key] | set <key> <value> | unset <key>`
    (dot-paths, value coercion, apiKey masking, Zod-validated). The TUI `/config` screen now
    exposes every knob.
  - Precedence: CLI flag > env (incl. `.env`) > config file > built-in default.
  - `cleak --version` now reports the real package version (was hardcoded), and `cleak tools`
    loads `.env`/config before resolving.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Path-sensitive static engine + a working HYBRID dynamic stage.
  - **Static engine (C/C++):** C++ support via `tree-sitter-cpp` with `new`/`delete`
    leak detection; switch/case guards in the CFG path analysis; dead-code
    reachability + path-sensitive/AST CFG hygiene (drops the old ±3-line and
    regex-on-AST heuristics).
  - **Dynamic analysis:** the HYBRID dynamic stage now actually produces correlated
    leak evidence (sanitizer runs no longer aborted by the address-space `ulimit`;
    `llvm-symbolizer` wired for file:line; a real LeakSanitizer leak parser). A new
    **deterministic** dynamic stage (build → LSan, no LLM) runs under `no_llm` when
    invoked with `--dynamic ≠ off` and a build command, enabling a clean
    LLM-orchestration × dynamic-evidence ablation.
  - **Judge:** consensus (k-sample) judge and richer evidence (ownership summaries,
    alloc→free pairs, feasible leak paths, static↔dynamic correlation).

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Initial public release: a globally-installable agentic CLI/TUI (`cleak`) for C/C++
  memory-leak investigation — MCP-driven static + dynamic (Valgrind/ASan/LSan) analysis
  with a heuristic + LLM consensus judge, and JSON/Markdown/HTML/snapshot reports.
